# OpenDyslexicMC
[OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/) font in the form of a Minecraft resource pack. The font was created by Abbie Gonzalez in order to make text easier to read for people with dyslexia.

This pack is for Java. However, [PiSaucer has made a fork for Bedrock](https://github.com/PiSaucer/OpenDyslexicMCBedrock).
